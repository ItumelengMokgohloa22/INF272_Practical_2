        <p>
            My name is Bohlale Thosago, and I am a 22-year-old student from Polokwane. I have always been passionate about technology, knowledge, and the way information is organized, which is why I chose to study Information Science. This field excites me because it combines technology with data management, offering endless opportunities to improve how people access and use information.
            Growing up in Polokwane, I was always curious about how systems work, from libraries to digital platforms. This curiosity led me to explore various aspects of information management, including databases, digital archiving, and cybersecurity. As the world becomes more digital, I believe that organizing and securing information is more important than ever..
